        <h2>A timeless classic of a cookie.</h2>
        <p>Here is my take on the classic Chocolate Chip Cookie.  Best served warm!  The buttery, chocolate flavor is out of this world!
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 Cup Butter</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup Brown Sugar (packed)</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>1 Large Egg</li>
            <li>1 3/4 Cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1/2 Teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
            <li>1/2 Teaspoon Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>1 Cup Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F.</li>
            <li>Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds. Butter should be completely melted but shouldn't be hot.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix butter with the sugars until well-combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in vanilla and egg until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Please read the recipe note about properly measuring flour.</li>
            <li>Mix dough until just combined. Dough should be soft and a little sticky but not overly sticky.</li>
            <li>Stir in chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Scoop out 1.5 tablespoons of dough (medium cookie scoop) and place 2 inches apart on baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until cookies are set. They will be puffy and still look a little underbaked in the middle.</li>
        </ol>
