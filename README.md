# odin-recipes
This is one of the first projects assigned by the Odin Project.  
The primary purpose of making this recipe page is to solidify HTML fundamentals.
The product may initially look not great, but at some point I will circle back to add CSS stylings to make it pretty.
Recipes included: No Bake Peanut Butter Cookies, Snickerdoodles, & Chocolate Chip Cookies.
